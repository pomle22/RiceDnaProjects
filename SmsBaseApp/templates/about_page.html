Over 20,000 of plant species found in Thailand represent 8% of all plant species found in the world. Due to high rate of habitat destruction in Thailand causing by human activities or by nature, the resulting habitat loss has continually and greatly reduced the country’s biodiversity in which some species including those that have not been discovered have already been extinct.  It is estimated that the extinction rate causing by habitat loss is 20-70 species per day while only one new species is found each week. This means that the discovery of new species occurs at a much slower rate than the extinction at 100-500 folds, which is at the threatening state. Fostering Thailand Bioeconomy requires efficient conservation and sustainable utilization of Thailand biological resources. " %}</p>

The ministry of higher education science research and innovation (MHESI), formerly the ministry of science and technology (MoST) granted major funding scheme to construct a national-scale Biobanking infrastructure which later became the National Biobank of Thailand (NBT). All biological samples that are brought to NBT will go through standard species identification as well as annotation process to ensure both authenticity and integrity of specimens stored in the Biobank. The annotated information for each specimen includes taxonomical data, information from molecular and genetic studies, and potential functional usage from our functional screening routine.  Thus, these authentic specimens preserved in NBT could serve as important stepping stones for the development of Thailand bioeconomy." %}</p>
